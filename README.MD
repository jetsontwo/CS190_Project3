# Suffered Forrest

The game is based around other games such as Journey and Flower in which the player has complete freedom to explore the environment and they have limited instruction or purpose.  In our game, the player starts in a world void of sound in which there are several mystical objects around them that draw in attention.  By picking up these items by using the “E” key, players can pick them up and bring them to a centralized pedestals, set up like an altar.  When these objects are placed down, they then activates sounds and effects related to the color of the relic and where it was found.  Given the freedom to find any of these pieces in any order, each player can have their own experience exploring the island and finding all the relics and enjoying the expanding environment around them.  As more and more relics are found, the world starts to become alive with sounds and ambient noises that truly show the player how much sounds to the world around them.
